# Line-follower-bot
A line follower robot is a type of autonomous robot that follows a line on the ground using sensors and motor control. Line follower robots are popular educational projects that introduce concepts such as sensor interfacing, motor control, and basic autonomous navigation. The swift improvement of robotics and automation has created a new pedestal for capital-efficient solutions in industrial and non-industrial applications the " SMART LUNE TRACKING ROBOT USING ARDUINO UNO AND SENSORS " is a real-life use following technology crafted to follow a pre-designed track highlighted by a line on a contrasting background this model uses the Arduino Uno microcontroller as the main control unit with a pair of infrared sensors (IR) sensors to locate and perceive the track
It is backed by a DC motor-driven chassis with a controlled handle by a L298N motor driver module The IR sensor relentlessly locates changes in the track reflectance, allowing the bot to manipulate its movement accordingly
A proportional control algorithm promises a steady and keen tracking along a curved or straight path
The bot's modular design ensures easy variation capabilities, making it adaptable to a list of applications such as materials handling, warehouse automation, and educational demonstration, Furthermore, the use of open-source parts like the Arduino Uno makes this bot budget-friendly and suitable for various fields.
